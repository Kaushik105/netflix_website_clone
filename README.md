# Netflix Website Clone
A project of Netflix clone made with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. This is only a frontend project.

I have followed the tutorial of Code With Harry in his Sigma Web Development Course. I have done so many modifcations and upgradations on the top of the given tutorial.

He didn't even used JS but I added functionalities with JS to make it more interactive and completely responsive.

Thank You ðŸ˜Š
